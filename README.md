## Getting Started on Flutter

This project is my first Flutter application.

I know there are innumerous ways to get started on Flutter, but I really think the [official documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs) is the best way to go.

Other than the docs, there are a few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:
- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

## Credits

The idea for this project is not mine, I would like to thank and credit the youtube channel [The Flutter Way](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJm7i4g4z7ZGcJA_HKHLCVw).
